<h2>Description</h2>
Ever tried playing on servers with shaders? Probably, and we can all agree that it can be annoying to always have constant dawn while playing in servers as it reduces visibility for shaders enjoyers. This Fabric mod will make you able to control time while playing client-side. Meaning that it will only change what the game displays to you and no other player’s. Additionally it doesn’t affect gameplay.

<h2>About updates</h2>
The mod will always be compatible and updated with the latest Minecraft version available and the version right before this one. The mod will only be updated for official releases.

<h2>How to use</h2>
This is fairly easy to use. Go in main menu or pause menu and select "Mods", then find Sunshine and click on the edit settings button to enable/disable and change time! You can now also use the "Y" key to enable or disable the mod, you can change this in Minecraft keybinds settings.

<h2>Looking for feedbacks!</h2>
Do you have an idea (I don't have any idea on how to improve the mod) or found a bug? Please create an issue on GitHub using the issues button on the side panel.
