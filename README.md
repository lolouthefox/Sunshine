<h2>Description</h2>
Ever tried playing on servers with shaders? Probably, and we can all agree that it can be annoying to always have constant dawn while playing in servers as it reduces visibility for shaders enjoyers. This Fabric mod will make you able to control time while playing client-side. Meaning that it will only change what the game displays to you and no other player’s. Additionally it doesn’t affect gameplay.

<h2>1.20 update</h2>
1.20 is coming soon and I will try my best to update the mod as soon as possible. I am currently waiting for the following mods to update their mods to 1.20 as they are essential dependencies;

 - ❎ Yet Another Config Lib
 - ❎ Cloth Config
 - ❎ Mod Menu

<h2>How to use</h2>
This is fairly easy to use. Go in main menu or pause menu and select "Mods", then find Sunshine and click on the edit settings button to enable/disable and change time!

<h2>Looking for feedbacks!</h2>
Do you have an idea (I don't have any idea on how to improve the mod) or found a bug? Please create an issue on GitHub using the issues button on the side panel.
